FORMULAS:

mean = sum/h

se = sd x/sqrt(h)
se - standard error of the mean
sd - standard deviation
x - sample
sqrt(h) - the square root of the number of observations

95% of all observations lie within the radius of mean +- 1.96se

H0 is the absence of significant differences between the mean of the sample and the mean of the population.
H1 is a significant deviation between the sample mean and the population mean.
p is the probability of obtaining such or even stronger deviation from the mean value, if H0 is true.
The smaller p, the more reasons to reject the null hypothesis.
Usually at p<0.05 we take H1, i.e. we got a statistically significant deviation.
So, if we got p<0.05 and took H1, which is a significant deviation of the mean value of the sample from the mean value of the population gene, thus we got 95% probability that this sample is unrepresentative.

df = n-1
